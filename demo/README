CLOUDPT CODE SNIPPETS
USING NODEJS
==========================================================================
By Meocloud Team (developers@meocloud.pt)

This code snippet uses modules: oauth, step, colors and optimist
Some snippets use optimist for arg handling

Installation
============
npm install oauth step colors optimist

Notes
=====
This sample uses the OAuth out-of-band authentication method but you
can easily change it to use a callback URL.
When using oob you have to manually enter a PIN to obtain your tokens

How to use this snippet
=======================

1. Edit auth.js and fill ONLY these two variables. Leave the other two unchanged
key    = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx";
secret = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx";

2. run node login.js
You'll get a link which you have to enter in your browser. After authorization you will be presented with a PIN that you have to enter in the prompt.
The result is an access_token and a token_secret

3. Edit auth.js again and now fill the other two variables with the values obtained from step 2
access_token = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx";
token_secret = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx";

4. Try any of the sample methods presented (delta, list, media, createFolder)
